# Sentiment-Analysis-Amazon-reviews

This project is a short introduction to VADER, the NLTK module that provides sentiment scores based on words used.

For instance :
- "completely" boosts a score, while "slightly" reduces it
- "GREAT!!!" is stronger than "great."
- words like "isn't" and "doesn't" affect the outcome)

In this mini project I analyze some Amazon and movie reviews. The Amazon reviews dataset contains 10,000 Amazon reviews. 
Like the movie reviews dataset, it is labeled as either "pos" (positive) or "neg" (negative). At the end we'll determine the accuracy of our sentiment analysis with VADER.
