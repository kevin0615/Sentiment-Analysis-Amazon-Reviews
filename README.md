# Sentiment-analysis-Amazon-reviews

This project is a short introduction to VADER, the NLTK module that provides sentiment scores based on words used.

For instance :
- "completely" boosts a score, while "slightly" reduces it
- "GREAT!!!" is stronger than "great."
- words like "isn't" and "doesn't" affect the outcome)

In this mini project I analyze some Amazon and movies reviews.
